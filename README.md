Hello, gentlemans!

The most right translation of the word "gentleman" into Russian tongue is a word combination "chelo vechar" that is a sign of a mental image "a head(wit, mind) of a —Åouncil(society)". In other words: gentleman - a man with a gentle(finely arranged, difficult, complex) soul - sage, wise man.

Thus, be gentleman!
